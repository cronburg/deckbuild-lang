% 10. Discuss what you would do next on your language if you were going to
%     continue working on it.

For the language itself, we would like to develop a type system that models the
cards and the rules of the game. This would lead to development of a
type-checker that we envision would help designers catch game design errors
earlier.

We would also like to have more relevant and useful debugging information.
Currently debugging information is limited to line numbers in the source file.
This would not be very useful to non-Haskell programmers.

For a better game design experience, we envision an automated card balancer that
attempts to balance the different design axes. While this isn't related to the
language, we think this would be a useful tool that could drive greater adoption
of DeckBuild.

The runtime system would ultimately be the tipping point for designers. Even if
game designers could easily specify the cards and game mechanics in DeckBuild,
they would have no incentive to do so if they had to implement the runtime
system too. To start with, we would like to have graphical client-server
support, markup language conversion tools, and a library of AI players that
designers can choose from.

We evaluated the effectiveness of DeckBuild language as a game design tool for
both programmers and non-programmers by considering game designer productivity.

We performed an informal evaluation of how easy it is to design cards using
DeckBuild. We used our DeckBuild language to describe all the existing cards
from the base set of Dominion \cite{DomCardList}. We found that specifying cards
in our language was easy and straightforward.
